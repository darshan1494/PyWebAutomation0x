### Web Automation Framework with Page Object Model in Python(Selenium)
- What is Framework & Why we create framework?
- A Framework is basically in context of software testing & software development is a standardized way to organize, design & building the software applications
  - It is generally used how will you organize, design & build our software applications.
- We are building software testing framework rite now which will basically help us to test & it doesn't matter how many number of testcases we add, this framework help us to scale & it will basically can help us to without modifying core functionality, we can easily add new number of testcases.
  - Our framework should be generic in nature means it should be compatible with all other web applications.
  
  **Frameworks are of different types:**
1) Data Driven testing framework by using parametrized command of pytest
2) Keyword testing framework
3) Behavior-driven development testing framework. It contains Feature files corresponds to-> Code Files. We will write behavior in the feature files & that behavior is basically bind together with code files. Feature files are basically read & taken care by Product/QA managers/Stakeholders which will be in simple English.Code is written by QA team & they don't care how code is written. They ensure whether testcases are written properly into Feature files.
4) Cucumber is not a testing framework. It has become a suite which means collection/multiple of tools
5) We are going to create Generic Hybrid Framework(Mixture of multiple types of frameworks) by using POM. Most of the companies use this framework which help us to achieveable, easy, OOPS concepts & it supports all types of websites.


- Framework allows to create a source code in such a way that:
1) Reusable in nature
2) Maintainability
3) Apply OOPS concepts & can achieve Abstraction , Encapsulation
4) Achieve Modularity
5) Achieve Scalability- If we want to add more number of testcases, we don't have to modify anything
6) Testing

- Python, PyTest
- Selenium
- Allure Report
- Gitignore, PyTest Report
- Page Object Model and Page Factory both
- Highlight element while run
- Parallel Run with xdist
- MY SQL data base connect to verify data.
